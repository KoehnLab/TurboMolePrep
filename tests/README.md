# Test cases

The test cases can be run via the `run_tests.sh` script. An exit code of `0` means all tests have passed and an exit code of `1` means that there was
an error while executing the test cases.

Note that you can only run the test cases in a TurboMole environment (e.g. where the respective tools are available in the `PATH`).
